Workspace Preview for TYPO3 CMS 8.7
===================================

Workspace Preview is an extension overriding the Workspace Preview shipped with the TYPO3 Core. Its intention is to provide a simple possibility for previewing a draft version of a page and provide buttons to immediately publish or discard the changes. This is inspired by the handling in TYPO3 Neos and allows implementing a "self-publishing" workflow for editors.

Use this extension only if you don't need a publishing workflow but want to have an easy-to-use self-publishing functionality. The extension disables the Workspaces module in the Backend and overrides the Workspaces Preview.
